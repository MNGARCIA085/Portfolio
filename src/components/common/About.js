              I was born in Montevideo, but my childhood and adolescence unfolded in Carmelo. My return to Montevideo 
              marked the beginning of my journey into the world of technology, 
              where I have since cultivated a deep passion for maths, software development and artificial intelligence.

              Outside of work, I engage in cycling and swimming, activities that keep me both mentally and 
              physically agile. 
              These sports have honed my determination, discipline, 
              and ability to tackle challengesâ€”qualities that I bring to my professional life.

            <br/>
            I'm also an avid fan of sitcoms, anime, and K-dramas. The laughter, creativity, 
            and rich storytelling they inspire provide a refreshing balance to my technical pursuits, 
            fueling my innovative thinking and problem-solving abilities.

            <br/> <br/>
            My journey, blending technical expertise with diverse life experiences, 
            shapes me as a committed and passionate professional, 
            ready to contribute to and grow within the fields of software development and AI.
